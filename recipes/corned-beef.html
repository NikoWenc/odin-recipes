    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Corned beef is a savory, canned meat made from finely shredded beef brisket that's been cured in salt and spices. In Filipino cuisine, it's commonly sautéed with onions (and sometimes potatoes) and served with rice and eggs for a hearty, flavorful breakfast.
